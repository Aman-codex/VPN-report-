## üõ† Steps Followed (as per guide)

### 1. Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up
- Selected **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)** for its strong privacy policy and AES-256 encryption.
- Created an account using my email and verified it.

### 2. Download and install the VPN client

- Installed using the default setup wizard.

### 3. Connect to a VPN server
- Chose the nearest **Free ‚Äì India** server for better speed.
- Successfully connected (green status icon displayed in app).

### 4. Verify IP address change
- **Before connection:** Checked IP via `whatismyipaddress.com` ‚Äî original IP displayed.
- **After connection:** IP changed to VPN server‚Äôs location.
- **Screenshots:** `vpn-ip-before.png`, `vpn-ip-after.png`.

### 5. Browse a website to confirm traffic encryption
- Accessed multiple HTTPS sites while connected.
- ProtonVPN app confirmed encryption using **WireGuard protocol**.

### 6. Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP
- Ran `fast.com` speed test **before** and **after** VPN connection.
- Observed a slight decrease in download/upload speed when VPN was active.
- Disconnected VPN and IP reverted to original.

### 7. Research VPN encryption and privacy features
- **Encryption:** AES-256 bit with WireGuard/OpenVPN tunneling.
